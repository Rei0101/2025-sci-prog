## 🚀 Getting Started

### For Development

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone [your-fork-url]
   cd 2025-sci-prog/projects/[projectname-student]
   ```

2. **Set up your environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Create your feature branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/[feature-name]
   ```

### For Instructors/Reviewers

1. View project documentation below
2. Check GitHub Issues for project planning
3. Review Pull Requests for development process

## 🔄 Development Workflow

### Daily Routine

1. **Start of Session (5 minutes)**
   - Review your goals for the session
   - Pull latest changes: `git pull origin main`
   - Create feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/[feature-name]`

2. **During Development**
   - **Write code** incrementally and test frequently
   - **Commit often** with descriptive messages
   - **Document your process** and decisions

3. **End of Session (10 minutes)**
   - **Push your branch**: `git push origin feature/[feature-name]`
   - **Create Pull Request** to main branch
   - **Review your own work** before merging

### Branch Strategy

- `main`: Protected branch for final, working code
- `feature/[feature-name]`: Individual feature branches
- All work happens on feature branches, never directly on main

### Pull Request Process

1. **Create PR** from feature branch to main
2. **Self-review** your changes carefully
3. **Use the PR template** (see below)
4. **Merge only after** testing and documentation is complete

## 📝 Pull Request Template

```markdown
## What I Did
- [ ] Feature 1 implemented
